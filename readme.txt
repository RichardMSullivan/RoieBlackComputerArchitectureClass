ReadMe

this is going to be a repository meant to hold all of the labs and homework
assignments for Roie Blacks compure architecture class at ACC.

each directory will be it's own assignment or a tool used 
in another directory within this repository

as assignments are uploaded I will update the readme to explain each one
providing details as to what each assignment is, and what I 
learned/had trouble with.

Assignment 1:
    this assignment was to set up a homework repository. I made a repo
    and added a readme file. 

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

    becasue I am not officially taking the class
    the repo is not shared with anyone nor will the assignments be graded.
    furthermore I have been granted permission by the professor to follow 
    along with the class and have access to the lecture notes and
    assignments via the class website.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignment 2:
    in this assignment we had to make a simple program that contains a simple
    function and contains includes. this is to make sure that the programming
    tools in place have been installed and are working correctly.
    
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

    the compiler I am using is g++. the text editor I am using is vim.
    
    later on I will be using make to automate the compilation and linking 
    process for my projects.

    late on I will use an IDE to learn about the features that come with
    an IDE.
