ReadMe

this is going to be a repository meant to hold all of the labs and homework
assignments for Roie Blacks compure architecture class at ACC.

each directory will be it's own assignment or a tool used 
in another directory within this repository

as assignments are uploaded I will update the readme to explain each one
providing details as to what each assignment is, and what I 
learned/had trouble with.

Assignment 1:
    this assignment was to set up a homework repository. I made a repo
    and added a readme file. becasue I am not officially taking the class
    the repo is not shared with anyone nor will the assignments be graded.
    furthermore I have been granted permission by the professor to follow 
    along with the class and have access to the lecture notes and
    assignments via the class website.
