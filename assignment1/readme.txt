the assignment was to create a github account.

The way I am setting up the repository is that each assignment will have a 
folder.

inorder to keep continuity I added a folder for assignment one despite
not needing one because the assignment was to make the repo

this is so my folders for the different assignments can be equal to the 
ones assigned without the need for starting at 2 with no explination

cheers!
